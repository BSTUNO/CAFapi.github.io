## Data Processing

The Data Processing service provides advanced processing functions to allow machines to interrogate and analyze a wide range of file formats.
With such a wide range of data sources, including email, voice and image, data analytics can be a challenging problem. The Data Processing
service allows you to create bespoke data processing pipelines, which perform any of the following data processing actions based on the file
type and metadata:

- Language Detection determines the languages present in a section of text.
- Boilerplate Removal removes commonly used text such as legal disclaimers.
- Classification uses natural language processing to classify data into user-defined categories.
- Email Signature Detection automatically identifies and segregates signature sections from emails.
- Email Key Content Segregation separates the top reply of email from previous replies.
- Numeric ID Tagging applies a unique identifier to files processed by the Data Processing service for tracking purposes.
- Entity Extraction constructs structured data, such as addresses, from unstructured text.
- OCR extracts text from images for further data processing actions.
- Speech extracts text from audio for further data processing actions.
- Text Extract extracts text, metadata and sub files from a wide range of file types.
