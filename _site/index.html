<p>The HPE Common Application Framework is a collection of microservices essential for any developer of big data appplications. We are the
recognized leaders in deliverying enterprise applications that manage unstructured information and we designed these services to form the core
of our next generation archiving, back-up, content management, and analytics products. We’re committed to open-sourcing all of these services
to more rapidly fuel innovation in the community as well as to provide standards with regards to the management of unstructured information at
scale.</p>

<p>Each microservice is wrapped in a Docker container for light-weight portability and rapid deployment. They can be deployed stand-alone or with
fault-tolerant queues running on Apache Mesos with Marathon for massive scalability and high availability. These services are designed for Saas
deployment and are fully multi-tenant aware.</p>

<p>Below we’ve summarized each microservice with links to the source code repository and documentation. For those services not yet opensourced,
they are available within the HPE Github enterprise instance.</p>

<p>The Data Processing service provides advanced processing functions to allow machines to interrogate and analyze a wide range of file formats.
With such a wide range of data sources, including email, voice and image, data analytics can be a challenging problem. The Data Processing
service allows you to create bespoke data processing pipelines, which perform any of the following data processing actions based on the file
type and metadata:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language Detection determines the languages present in a section of text.</li>
  <li>Boilerplate Removal removes commonly used text such as legal disclaimers.</li>
  <li>Classification uses natural language processing to classify data into user-defined categories.</li>
  <li>Email Signature Detection automatically identifies and segregates signature sections from emails.</li>
  <li>Email Key Content Segregation separates the top reply of email from previous replies.</li>
  <li>Numeric ID Tagging applies a unique identifier to files processed by the Data Processing service for tracking purposes.</li>
  <li>Entity Extraction constructs structured data, such as addresses, from unstructured text.</li>
  <li>OCR extracts text from images for further data processing actions.</li>
  <li>Speech extracts text from audio for further data processing actions.</li>
  <li>Text Extract extracts text, metadata and sub files from a wide range of file types.</li>
</ul>

<p>Elements is the only open source user interface framework for building modern, responsive, mobile big data applications on the web. Elements
provides all of the essentials required for your big data project, allowing you to swiftly create dashboards and reports that provide users with the
insights they crave from their big data applications. Elements is based on best-of-breed, open source technologies, including AngularJS,
Bootstrap and D3. It is easy to include in your web applications with the Bower web package manager.</p>

<p>The Identity Management service provides authentication and authorization of end users as well as other, related micro-services. The Identity
Management service implements authentication and authorization of end users as well as other, related micro-services. Authentication uses the
industry standard OAUTH 2Ŀ0 protocol with encrypted tokens of varying life spans. For user management, Identity Management supports
enterprise hierarchy and AD/LDAP for customer hierarchy. Any number of applications can register their roles and permissions with the service.
Application administrators can assign application-specific roles and permissions to users. Leveraging this service relieves you of having to create
these core building blocks of any SaaS application on your own.</p>

            <h2 id="worker-framework">Worker Framework</h2>

<p>The Worker Framework is a set of building blocks for asynchronous, distributed, data-processing microservices known as workers. This
framework is designed for high scalability and fault tolerance, and is easily extensible. The Worker Framework provides a foundation for crossplatform,
cloud-ready, distributed data-processing microservices (workers). The framework is designed for massive scalability, redundancy,
elasticity and resilience, which are achieved through architectural choices and technologies like Docker, Apache Mesos, Marathon and queuebased
messaging with RabbitMQ. You can extend this framework through integration with many external and internal components, such as
storage services. The Worker Framework is a good fit for any data-processing scenario, including both on-premise and cloud-based solutions
delivered as SaaS. For example, the Worker Framework could benefit solutions for content processing, mathematical and statistical analysis, and
image and audio processing. The Worker Framework is written entirely in Java and features the necessary infrastructure for execution of
workers, messaging with fault-tolerant queues, monitoring, scaling, error handling and external data exchange. It also includes a set of base
classes and interfaces allowing rapid development and integration.</p>

            <h2 id="job-service">Job Service</h2>

<p>The Job service provides an extensible framework for the distributed processing of batch workloads using an elastically scaled pool of workers
built using the worker framework. The Job service’s extensible design allows you to define a batch of work and provide a batch processor plugin
that interprets a batch, splitting it into smaller batches or individual items of work upon which the service can act. The process of batch splitting
is scaled elastically using the autoscaler, allowing sub-batches of a larger batch to be processed in parallel. The individual items of work emerge
and go into the RabbitMQ queue, which is defined in the job and processed by workers. The workers also scale elastically based on the load.</p>

<p>The Autoscaler service provides on-demand scaling of services, allowing you to efficiently dedicate resources where they are needed most in
your Mesos cluster, and minimizing costs and ensuring user satisfaction. The Autoscaler is an extensible framework, which allows you to provide
your own modules to retrieve services to scale, metrics to make scaling decisions and instigate a scaling action. The Autoscaler service provides 
a source for Marathon that identifies services to scale using Marathon labels. A RabbitMQ workload analyzer retrieves details of RabbitMQ
queues to make scaling decisions. A Marathon application scaler issues commands to the Marathon REST API to scale up and down a service.</p>

<p>The Marathon Loader is a Java application that automates the process of deploying Marathon applications. You create a directory structure of
applications and Marathon templates using $ placeholders to allow values to be modified for different environments. Create various Java or
JSON property files to map placeholders to values and then use the loader to send the fully-formed applications to Marathon. The Marathon
Loader can also be used to create environment-specific configuration files that are supplied to the Mesos sandboxes of applications.</p>
