# The HPE Common Application Framework

The HPE Common Application Framework is a collection of microservices essential for any developer of big data appplications. We are the
recognized leaders in deliverying enterprise applications that manage unstructured information and we designed these services to form the core
of our next generation archiving, back-up, content management, and analytics products. We’re committed to open-sourcing all of these services
to more rapidly fuel innovation in the community as well as to provide standards with regards to the management of unstructured information at
scale.

Each microservice is wrapped in a Docker container for light-weight portability and rapid deployment. They can be deployed stand-alone or with
fault-tolerant queues running on Apache Mesos with Marathon for massive scalability and high availability. These services are designed for Saas
deployment and are fully multi-tenant aware.

Below we’ve summarized each microservice with links to the source code repository and documentation. For those services not yet opensourced,
they are available within the HPE Github enterprise instance.
