## Worker Framework

The Worker Framework is a set of building blocks for asynchronous, distributed, data-processing microservices known as workers. This
framework is designed for high scalability and fault tolerance, and is easily extensible. The Worker Framework provides a foundation for crossplatform,
cloud-ready, distributed data-processing microservices (workers). The framework is designed for massive scalability, redundancy,
elasticity and resilience, which are achieved through architectural choices and technologies like Docker, Apache Mesos, Marathon and queuebased
messaging with RabbitMQ. You can extend this framework through integration with many external and internal components, such as
storage services. The Worker Framework is a good fit for any data-processing scenario, including both on-premise and cloud-based solutions
delivered as SaaS. For example, the Worker Framework could benefit solutions for content processing, mathematical and statistical analysis, and
image and audio processing. The Worker Framework is written entirely in Java and features the necessary infrastructure for execution of
workers, messaging with fault-tolerant queues, monitoring, scaling, error handling and external data exchange. It also includes a set of base
classes and interfaces allowing rapid development and integration.
