# What is CAF?

Common Application Framework is a platform for building next generation cloud based applications. 

It provides Identity Management, Storage, Auditing, Job Services, Data Processing and Document Classification services as well as frameworks for creating new services.

Developed using Microservices architecture, the Framework utilizes fault-tolerant queues for messaging, Docker containers for packaging and rapid deployment as well as Apache Mesos with Marathon for orchestration and massive scalability.
