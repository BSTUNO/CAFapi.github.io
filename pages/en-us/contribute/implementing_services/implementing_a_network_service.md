Notes for future completion of this page.

Recommend Dropwizard for the creation of REST API's, teams are free to use alternative frameworks as required, but consider the overhead for support teams debugging a heterogeneous collection of technologies.
Authentication and SSL for secured communications.
Access to log files.

Integration with logging service.
